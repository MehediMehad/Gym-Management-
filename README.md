## Project Overview: Blogging Platform Backend

Developed a robust backend system for a blogging platform with the following key features:

-   **Role Management:** Implemented two roles—**Admin** and **User**—with distinct permissions. Admins can manage users and their blogs, while users can perform CRUD operations on their own blogs.
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensured secure authentication using bcrypt.js for password hashing and JWT for token-based access control. Incorporated role-based access control to restrict unauthorized actions.
-   **Blog Management:** Enabled users to create, read, update, and delete blogs, ensuring seamless content management.
-   **Public Blog API:** Built a public API to display blogs with **advanced features** like search, sort, and filter for efficient content discovery.
-   **Security & Scalability:** Followed best practices to secure sensitive data and designed the system to handle increasing user demands.

This project showcases my expertise in backend development, secure authentication, and implementing scalable RESTful APIs.

## Error Handling

Error handling is crucial in ensuring that an application responds gracefully to unexpected situations, providing users with meaningful feedback while maintaining system stability. A well-structured error response format helps in identifying and diagnosing issues effectively.

### Common Error Response Format

To maintain consistency across all API endpoints, the following error response structure will be used:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Error message describing the issue",
    "statusCode": 400, // or other relevant HTTP status code
    "error": { "details": "Additional error details, if applicable" },
    "stack": "error stack trace, if available"
}
```

#### Types of Errors Handled

The following common errors will be managed with appropriate responses:

-   **Zod Validation Error** (`ZOD_ERROR`): Errors arising from invalid data inputs based on Zod schema validation.
-   **Not Found Error** (`NOT_FOUND_ERROR`): When requested resources (e.g., a user, item, or page) are not found.
-   **Validation Error** (`VALIDATION_ERROR`): General validation errors (e.g., incorrect data format, missing required fields).
-   **Authentication Error** (`AUTH_ERROR`): Issues related to failed authentication (e.g., invalid token or expired session).
-   **Authorization Error** (`AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`): When the user lacks the necessary permissions to access a resource.
-   **Internal Server Error** (`INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`): Unhandled errors or unexpected server issues.

By consistently implementing these error handling mechanisms, we ensure a smooth user experience and easier debugging for developers.
